# Heroku_Used_Car_Price_Prediction

This project is aimed at creating interactive visualization to understand the relation between price of pre-owned cars and various features such as car brand, condition, mileage, location etc. <br>

This project has two parts- <br>
1) Creating interactive visualization : We used PowerBI for creating dashboard and hosted it here. <br>
